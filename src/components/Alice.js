          <P>
            Alice was created by Umbrella as a clone of Alicia Marcus, the
            daughter of co-founder James Marcus. Alice's purpose was to protect
            the Looking Glass House and she remained unaware of her true nature
            as a clone, thinking that she was the original as all Umbrella
            clones were created to believe. To the public, she was married to
            Spence; however, their marriage was a shame for the sake of guarding
            the mansion. They became romantically involved at some point down
            the line.
          </P>
          <P>
            In 2002, Alice began talking to an Umbrella researcher named Lisa
            Addison, who was secretly a mole working for former FBI agent Matt
            Addison. Rather than arrest her, Alice offered to help Lisa expose
            Umbrella's bio-weapons research through a plan to disable the Red
            Queen security system and allow the theft of a T-virus sample. Alice
            had likely been influenced by Alicia's innate sense of compassion.
